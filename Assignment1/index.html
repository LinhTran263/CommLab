                        <h3>Our NYUAD</h3>
                        <p>After more than a year I studied at this university, there has been a lot of changes and the weird things going on. So this place is a place that I can collect all of the things I see as new things as a Sophomore or the weird thing that are existing. Currently, the list includes the Campus Cats, Campus Map, and the plants in the university area.</p>

                        <p>The best thing in the university life is probably the presence of the cats. In every sunny days, they will be sunbathing on a comfortable chair or enjoying their sleep under the sun. On the windy days, we can see them finding someplace to block the wind blowing them. Finally, they are probaly the therapist of most NYUAD students</p>

                        <p>Have you ever noticed that we have a new campus map? Its only version was the wall of A5 near A4 side. However, the map is giving opposite directions. In fact, the D2 on the map is on the D1 side and vice versa. Apparently, this was a problem for the old map too. At least the new campus map is easier to understand and more precise about the names and positions.</p>

                        <p>Probably, the best way to enjoy your food or a cup of coffee after hours of working and studying is sitting under the palm tree. The winds coming from the sea and the cats going around and asking for cuddles. Also, there are a few flowers that just newly grown this semester. Sometimes, it is best to stop and look around for the nature in campus.</p>

                        <p>We are surrounding by multiple weird things in our university that can always be used as a conversation starter. Such as, we have a bookstore hallway where all you can see is the bookstore posters. Or another thing is the unmatched colors of the tiles near D1. Or just the weirdly organized room number where 114 is before 112. Just rememebr to look around more frequenty instead of your phone.
